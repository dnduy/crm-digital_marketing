# A/B Testing Header Warning Fix - Complete Solution

## 🚨 Problem Resolved
**Warning:** `Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /var/www/html/views/layout.php:6)`

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because:
1. `layout_header()` was called immediately in the function (line 7)
2. Form submissions requiring redirects were processed **after** HTML output had started
3. Once output begins, PHP cannot send headers (like `Location:` redirects)

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Restructured Function Flow
```php
// BEFORE: ❌ Headers sent after output
function view_ab_testing($op) {
    layout_header('A/B Testing');  // ← Output starts here
    
    if($_POST) {
        // Process form...
        header('Location: ...'); // ← FAILS! Headers already sent
    }
}

// AFTER: ✅ Process forms before output
function view_ab_testing($op) {
    // Process ALL form submissions FIRST
    if($op === 'new' && $_POST) {
        // Handle form...
        header('Location: ...'); // ← Works! No output yet
        exit;
    }
    
    layout_header('A/B Testing'); // ← Output starts here
    // Display forms and content...
}
```

### 2. Form Processing Moved to Top
- **New A/B Test Creation:** Moved POST processing before any output
- **Update Results:** Moved POST processing before any output
- **All Redirects:** Now happen before HTML output begins

### 3. Code Deduplication
- Removed duplicate `update_results` processing section
- Consolidated all form handling at the top of the function
- Maintained clean separation between logic and presentation
